Describe the benefits and liabalities of each approach to the key structure.

There would be no surrogrates in the Region class and District class when the only surrogate key we use is the Employee.
Without any surrogates, a bigger Primary Key is required, hence the more usage of storage space.
When surrogate keys are used it makes it easier to look up stuff in the database.
For example, We use ID for Region, District and State instead of names to make it easier and faster to search for it.
It also makes it convenient and efficient option to go through the database and get a specific result.
In this case, we also use less processing power.
This allows us to store more useful information to be stored and accessed when we want to.
