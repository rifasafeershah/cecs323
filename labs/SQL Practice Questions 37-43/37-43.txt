      SELECT DISTINCT CustomerName AS "Customer"

              FROM Orders
              WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2015);
      
      SELECT DISTINCT CustomerName AS "Customer"
      FROM Customers
      EXCEPT
      SELECT CustomerName AS "Customer"
      FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders
      WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2015;
      
38. List all people that we deal with (employees and customer contacs). Display first name, last name, company name (or employee) (145)

      FROM Employees;
      
39. List the last name, first name, and employee number of all the employees who do not have any customers. Order by last name first, then the first name. (8)
      SELECT LastName, FirstName
      FROM Employees
      EXCEPT
      SELECT LastName, FirstName
      FROM Employees INNER JOIN Customers
      ON Employees.EmployeeNumber = Customers.SalesRepresentativeEmployeeNumber
      ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;
      
40. List the states and the country that the state is part of that have customers but not offices, offices but not customers, or both one or more 
customers and one or more offices all in one query. Designate which state is which with the string 'Customer', 'Office', or 'Both'. If a state falls into the "Both" category, do not list it as a Customer or an Office state. Order by the country, then the state. Give the category column (where you list 'Customer', 'Office', or 'Both') a header of "Category" and exclude any entreies in which the state is null. (19)
      --Customers but not Offices
        (SELECT "Customer" AS "Category", "State" AS "State", Country AS "Country"
        FROM Customers
        WHERE "State" IS NOT NULL
        EXCEPT

        (SELECT "Office" AS "Category", "State" AS "State", Country AS "Country"
        FROM Offices
        WHERE "State" IS NOT NULL
        EXCEPT
        SELECT "Office" AS "Category", "State" AS "State", Country AS "Country"
        FROM Customers)
        UNION
      --Both one or more Customers and one or more Offices
        SELECT "Both" AS "Category", Customers."State" AS "State", Customers.Country AS "Country"
        FROM Customers INNER JOIN Offices
        ON Customers."State" = Offices."State" AND Customers.Country = Offices.Country;
        
41. List the Product Code and Product name of every product that has never been in an order in which the customer asked for more than 48 of them. Order by the Product Name. (8)
      SELECT ProductCode, ProductName
      FROM Products
      WHERE ProductCode
      NOT IN (SELECT ProductCode
              FROM OrderDetails
              WHERE QuantityOrdered > 48)
      ORDER BY ProductName;

42. List the first name and last name of any customer who ordered any products from either of the two product lines 'Trains' or 'Trucks and Buses'. Do not use an "or". Instead perform a union. Order by the customer's name. (61)
      SELECT ContactFirstName AS "First Name", COntactLastName AS "Last Name"
      FROM Customers
      NATURAL JOIN Orders
      NATURAL JOIN OrderDetails
      NATURAL JOIN Products
      WHERE ProductLine = "Trains"
      UNION
      SELECT ContactFirstName AS "First Name", ContactLastName AS "Last Name"
      FROM Customers
      NATURAL JOIN Orders
      NATURAL JOIN OrderDetails
      NATURAL JOIN Products
      WHERE ProductLine = "Trucks and Buses"
