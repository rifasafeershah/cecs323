18. Display every order along with the details of that order for order numbers 10270, 10272, 10279 (23)
    Hint: this can be done two ways. Try both of them. Which is easier if you have a large number of selection criteria?
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    NATURAL JOIN OrderDetails
    WHERE OrderNumber = 10270 OR OrderNumber = 10272 OR OrderNumber = 10279;

    SELECT DISTINCT ProductLine, TextDescription, ProductVendor
    FROM Products
    NATURAL JOIN ProductLines;
